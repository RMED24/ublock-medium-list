# ublock-medium-rule-list
A rule list for websites that break when using uBO medium mode. This is mostly for my personal use, however it is public if anyone else would like to use it or even contribute. 

Accepting your contributions may take a while, as I'd like for them to be tested beforehand. 

Please default to only disabling 3rd party scripts and not the frames, unless the frames break the website too of course

However, I'd prefer if you could figure out the exact domains causing problems on any given website instead if just disabling it for the whole page...
