# ublock-medium-list
A rule list for websites that break when using uBO medium mode. This is mostly for my personal use, however it is public if anyone else would like to use it or even contribute. 

THE GOAL IS TO ALLOW PAGES TO FULLY FUNCTION, WITH AS MINIMAL TRACKERS POSSIBLE. With this being said, not all websites will be perfect for now. With some websites listed still broken in some way, or finding out that some trackers don't need to be bypassed for a website to work. 

Accepting your contributions may take a while, as I'd like for them to be tested beforehand. 

Please default to only disabling the specific domains which cause trouble. If you genuinely can't figure it out or the website just is that broken, try only disabling 3rd party scripts. If that still doesn't work then disable blocking of both 3rd party scripts and frames, but only use this as a last resort.
